# We would need to import the relevant parts of our game code here.
# For testing purposes, we might refactor the combat logic into a separate function
# that takes player_pos, enemy_pos, and enemy_health as input and returns the new enemy_health
# and a flag indicating if the enemy was defeated.

# Example of a simplified combat function for testing:
def simulate_combat(player_pos, enemy_pos, enemy_health):
    enemy_defeated = False
    if player_pos == enemy_pos and enemy_health > 0:
        enemy_health -= 1
        if enemy_health <= 0:
            enemy_defeated = True
    return enemy_health, enemy_defeated

        initial_enemy_health = 10
        new_enemy_health, enemy_defeated = simulate_combat([0, 0], [0, 0], initial_enemy_health)
        self.assertEqual(new_enemy_health, initial_enemy_health - 1)
        self.assertFalse(enemy_defeated)
